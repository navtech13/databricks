# Databricks design system

This repository contains the new implementation of the Databricks design system. It uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
to handle the styling of our components, along with recommended tooling. This allows the use of design tokens to keep rules consistent throughout
the entire library.

The following figma files were used in the process of building and structuring the components:

- [Libraries - Design System](https://www.figma.com/files/814192388377136035/project/5433509/Libraries---Design-System?fuid=1118622308097035090)
  - [Components](https://www.figma.com/file/YyoW1ajs6G7Q0fLOVy6OAg/Components)
  - [Modules](https://www.figma.com/file/mS07ikgC58JBGqbZRQEXpz/branch/wpeucjVxDzF61Ty3l8luYv/Modules)
- [Blog](https://www.figma.com/file/Xd1MMzT4bSwSA3dMfc7sI7/Blog)

## Storybook structure

There are three main sections to our Storybook:

- **Foundations Library**: contains examples for the base design tokens that are used throughout the components.
- **Components**: List each individual component in the library.
- **Pages**: Shows components grouped together to build complete pages.

The left side panel has a search functionality to quickly find specific stories.

## Storybook features

Storybook is a very powerful tool that provides many useful features to interact and analyze Design Systems. The following
is a list of the features that are present in this design system.

### Accessibility check

Every story will run an accessibility check on the component's shown onscreen. This will be shown under the accessibility tab
in the lower menu. It includes a description of every check that runs, including the severity of the error, the affected elements,
and a link to documentation with more information.

<Image

  alt='Accessibility tool'
  className='mx-auto max-w-[400px]'
  caption='Accesibility tab'
/>

The affected elements can be highlighted by toggling the checkbox to the right of each error. The accessibility can be triggered at any time
by hitting the `Test completed` button on the lower right corner.

  alt='Accessibility results'
  className='mx-auto max-w-[400px]'
  caption='Hightlight and test completed buttons'
/>

### Vision simulator

This tool simulates how the components look under eye conditions. Helps to validate the color accessibility of the components.

  alt='Vision tool'
  className='mx-auto max-w-[400px]'
  caption='Vision tool'
/>

### Controls

Every story has a way of interacting with the values consumed by the components. There will be a controls tab in the lower menu which
includes inputs to alter the information displayed. This allows to preview the components in different scenarios (custom text, different
display modes, etc.)

<Image
  src='/static/images/sb-controls.png'
  alt='Storybook controls'
  className='mx-auto max-w-[400px]'
  caption='Component controls'
/>

### Zoom controls

The top menu has a set of three buttons used to control the size of the stories.

  alt='Zoom tool'
  className='mx-auto max-w-[400px]'
  caption='Zoom controls'
/>

### Viewport preview

This tool helps simulate the stories under different viewport dimensions.

<Image
  src='/static/images/sb-vw.png'
  alt='Viewport preview tool'
  className='mx-auto max-w-[400px]'
  caption='Viewport and open canvas buttons'
/>

Alternatively, the `Open canvas in new tab` button can be used to display the story by itself in a separate tab and use the
browser developers tools to simulate screen sizes.

### Measure tools

These two buttons are used to visualize the boundaries for the elements present in the story.

<Image
  src='/static/images/sb-measure.png'
  alt='Measure tool'
  className='mx-auto max-w-[400px]'
  caption='Measure tool'
/>

The first button enables the `Measure view`, where elements can be hovered over to reveal their measurements using the
[box model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_box_model) structure. This is specially useful when comparing components
to their intended design in the Figma files.

<Image
  src='/static/images/sb-outline.png'
  alt='Outline tool'
  className='mx-auto max-w-[400px]'
  caption='Outline tool'
/>

The second button draws an outline around every element on the page, to give a general overview of how the different
elements in the story are organized.

### Background tools

<Image

  alt='Background tool'
  className='mx-auto max-w-[400px]'
  caption='Dark background view'
/>

Two buttons used to manipulate the background canvas where the components are rendered. The first one toggles light/dark
backgrounds.

<Image
  src='/static/images/sb-grid.png'
  alt='Background grid'
  className='mx-auto max-w-[400px]'
  caption='Grid view'
/>

The second one toggles a grid to visualize the limits of each component.

### Docs

Each component has documentation that can be accessed in the top menu's `Docs` tab. Technical information such as the
components' props and usage rules is displayed here. Developers who implement this library should refer to this
section when using the components.

<Image
  src='/static/images/sb-docs.png'
  alt='Docs tab'
  sx={{ textAlign: "center", py: "10px", img: { maxWidth: "80vw" } }}
  caption='Grid view'
/>
